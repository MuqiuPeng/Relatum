### Project restructure
v1 archived under `v1/` at tag `v1.0`. v2 scaffolded at `v2/` with an empty
Rust package: only the `R(x, y)` struct and three invariant tests
(construction, directionality, token-based identity).

Decision: [0001-project-restructure](decisions/0001-project-restructure.md).
Commits: `b8aaa84`, `79541ea`.

### RSet harness
Added `RSet` — a deduplicated R-instance container with observation methods
(`identifiers`, `left_of`, `right_of`). Zero interpretation at this layer.

Decision: [0002-rset-harness](decisions/0002-rset-harness.md).
Commit: `5abdb73`.

### IdentifierProfile (first pass)
Added `profile(id)` returning `(degree_out, degree_in, slots)`. First-pass
answer to the "object emergence" question: structurally salient identifiers
can be found by comparing profiles, but the profile itself makes no salience
judgment. Richer granularity (neighbor sets, self-loop flag, co-occurrence,
multi-hop) documented in the ADR as deferred candidates.

Decision: [0003-identifier-profile](decisions/0003-identifier-profile.md).
Commit: `8886d53`.

### Traceability infrastructure
Added `docs/practices.md`, `docs/decisions/` (with index), `docs/progress.md`,
and `logs/` directory. Backfilled ADRs 0001–0003 to cover the work above.
