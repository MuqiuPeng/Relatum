### Project restructure
v1 archived under `v1/` at tag `v1.0`. v2 scaffolded at `v2/` with an empty
Rust package: only the `R(x, y)` struct and three invariant tests
(construction, directionality, token-based identity).

Decision: [0001-project-restructure](decisions/0001-project-restructure.md).
Commits: `b8aaa84`, `79541ea`.

### RSet harness
Added `RSet` — a deduplicated R-instance container with observation methods
(`identifiers`, `left_of`, `right_of`). Zero interpretation at this layer.

Decision: [0002-rset-harness](decisions/0002-rset-harness.md).
Commit: `5abdb73`.

### IdentifierProfile (first pass)
Added `profile(id)` returning `(degree_out, degree_in, slots)`. First-pass
answer to the "object emergence" question: structurally salient identifiers
can be found by comparing profiles, but the profile itself makes no salience
judgment. Richer granularity (neighbor sets, self-loop flag, co-occurrence,
multi-hop) documented in the ADR as deferred candidates.

Decision: [0003-identifier-profile](decisions/0003-identifier-profile.md).
Commit: `8886d53`.

### Traceability infrastructure
Added `docs/practices.md`, `docs/decisions/` (with index), `docs/progress.md`,
and `logs/` directory. Backfilled ADRs 0001–0003 to cover the work above.

Commit: `6a1f4f9`.

### Structural signature — first pass
`signature(id)` aliased to `profile(id)`; added `equivalence_classes()` on
`RSet`. Two identifiers are structurally equivalent iff their 0-hop profiles
are equal. 6 new unit tests cover chain / cycle / star / disjoint-union
collapse behavior.

Ran the first v2 experiment (`examples/structural_equivalence.rs`) over
six canonical small graphs. Findings:
- Role classification works as intended — head/middle/tail in chains,
  pivot-vs-leaves in stars, full collapse in cycles.
- Disjoint unions merge equivalent roles across components without extra
  machinery.
- 0-hop is **not** sufficient for naming compound patterns (e.g., "this
  is a chain of three"); that is a separate, later mechanism.

0-hop signatures are adopted as the role-classification layer; no immediate
upgrade to 1-hop needed. Open questions for the next layer (pattern
detection) are listed at the end of the experiment log.

Commit: `1437569`.

### R-instance signature — edge-level (first pass)
Lifted the signature machinery one level: `RSignature = (Signature, Signature)`
(ordered endpoint profiles), with `r_signature(&R)` and
`r_equivalence_classes()` on `RSet`. 6 new unit tests plus an
`edge_equivalence.rs` example covering the same six canonical graphs as
the identifier-level demo.

All six ADR-0005 predictions verified. Key findings:
- **First "repetition inside a single graph."** The 5-chain's middle-middle
  edges `R(a2,a3)` and `R(a3,a4)` merge into one class — the first
  single-graph-derived multi-member class not caused by pure symmetry.
  This is the signal a later pattern-mining layer can mine.
- **Direction is preserved.** Bidirectional chain produces three distinct
  classes (out-from-end, in-to-end, middle-middle) because pair order matters.
- **Stars reduce to "one edge type repeated."** Both out-star and in-star
  collapse their spokes; shape of the compound-pattern definition starts
  to come into view.
- **Cycles and stars collide at this layer** — both go to a single class.
  Distinguishing them requires a locality / co-occurrence signal, which
  is the motivation for the next ADR.

Decision: [0005-r-instance-signature](decisions/0005-r-instance-signature.md).
Log: [logs/2026-04-23_edge_equivalence.log](../logs/2026-04-23_edge_equivalence.log).

Commit: `5b8d116`.

### Locality profile (α)
Added `LocalityProfile { co_left, co_right, forward, reverse }` and
`locality_profile(&R)` on `RSet`. Counts of four kinds of 1-hop neighbor
relations: share left endpoint, share right endpoint, forward chain
(this.y == other.x), reverse chain (this.x == other.y). Directional by
design per commitment 2. 6 new unit tests; `examples/locality.rs` covers
the six canonical graphs plus an explicit chain-middle / cycle-edge
collision check.

All ADR 0006 predictions matched. Principal result:

- **Cycle vs star separated.** Cycle edge: `(0,0,1,1)`. Out-star spoke:
  `(2,0,0,0)`. In-star spoke: `(0,2,0,0)`. Three distinct locality
  fingerprints where the edge signature (0005) saw only "one class per graph."
- **Bidirectional chain structure becomes visible.** Endpoint edges and
  interior edges have different locality profiles, separating them
  cleanly where 0005's edge classes only grouped them by direction.
- **Known 1-hop collision locked.** Chain-middle and cycle-edge both have
  `(0,0,1,1)` — deferred, with a test that fails if the collision is ever
  intentionally broken by a 2-hop upgrade.

### Note on γ's dormancy (observation, not decision)
Every mechanism in v2 so far is deterministic derivation from the RSet:
there are no choice points, so self-driven triggering (γ) has nothing to
trigger. γ becomes load-bearing at β (compound pattern naming), where
"which patterns to name" is genuinely a choice. Captured in ADR 0006's
Context to avoid later confusion about why γ was postponed this long.

Decision: [0006-locality-profile](decisions/0006-locality-profile.md).
Log: [logs/2026-04-23_locality.log](../logs/2026-04-23_locality.log).

Commit: `1cbcf5f`.

### Compound signature probe (0007) — observation before β
Added `EdgeFingerprint = (RSignature, LocalityProfile)` and
`edge_fingerprint()` as a small probe utility. Ran on a mixed 14-edge
graph (5-chain + 3-cycle + 3-spoke star + 3-edge tree + 1 isolated edge)
to see what compound classes fall out.

Result: 14 edges partition into 7 compound classes, with sizes
`{5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1}`.

Key findings:
- **Biggest class (5) is the predicted 1-hop collision** — 2 chain-middle
  edges merged with all 3 cycle edges. Naive "name the biggest class"
  would pick the known false-merge.
- **Genuine cross-structure merge (size 2)** — chain-tail `R(c4,c5)` and
  tree-leaf-edge `R(t2,t4)` share a signature. Structurally both are
  "edge descending into a terminal node"; naming this would abstract
  "terminal descent." Likely a legitimate pattern.
- **Star spokes (size 3)** form a clean same-component class — the most
  textbook repetition.
- **4 of 7 classes are singletons.** Chain head and tree edges don't
  repeat; "pattern from size-1 classes" is not free.

β question (ii) answered empirically: **size > 1 is necessary but not
sufficient**. The biggest candidate is a false merge. A sanity filter is
needed. Two forms identified:
- (a) **2-hop tie-breaker** — cheap, breaks the specific collision.
- (b) **Subgraph coherence check** — closer to the design-notes goal of
  naming whole structures (like "integer chain").

γ also takes concrete shape for the first time: its first real job is
applying this sanity filter.
