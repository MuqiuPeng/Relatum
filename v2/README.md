# Relatum v2

Autonomous abstraction from a single binary directed relation.

## Primitive

```
R(x, y)
```

One relation. Two slots. A direction. No meaning.
Everything else must emerge.

## Documentation

- [docs/constitution.md](docs/constitution.md) — five non-negotiable ontological commitments
- [docs/design-notes.md](docs/design-notes.md) — internal design reference for the v2 direction
- [docs/practices.md](docs/practices.md) — working practices (traceability, minimum-first, constitution check)
- [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/) — ADRs for all non-trivial technical decisions
- [docs/progress.md](docs/progress.md) — chronological progress log
- [logs/](logs/) — experiment output logs

## Build

```
cargo test
```

## Status

Observation layer in place: `R`, `RSet`, `IdentifierProfile`.
Abstraction mechanisms (structural signature, pattern detection, type
naming, self-driven triggering, evaluation) not yet implemented.
See [docs/progress.md](docs/progress.md) for the current frontier.
